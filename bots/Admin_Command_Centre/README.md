# VM Admin Command Centre v0.2.0

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Add only `VM_ADMIN_BOT_TOKEN`.
3. Start the bot. If no admin is configured, the Windows console prints a one-time claim code.
4. Send `/claim <code>` to the bot in a private chat. Your numeric Telegram user ID is stored locally automatically.
5. Keep `VM_ADMIN_ALLOW_MUTATIONS=false` until read-only commands are verified.
